## Techniques

Protobuf schemas necessary for communicating with the Tinder API are reversed procedurally. Disassembly produced by apktool is stored on disk then parsed using the scripts included in this repository. On conventional hardware, a complete .proto file can be generated in several hours using these .smali parsers.

For most applications built with protobuf, we find that a .proto file can almost always be extracted using parser/generators similar to ones included here.

Similarly, the JSON API schema was reversed into TypeScript interface definitions, and the HTTP route definitions extracted from DEX labels associated with retrofit2.

To ease the task of replicating a generic API call, frida was used to remove CA pinning using standard CA-unpinning scripts, then network requests captured from a victim Android system.
